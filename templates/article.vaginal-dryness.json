            "custom_text_body": "<p>Besides menopause, there are several other contributors to vaginal dryness, such as:<\/p><ul><li>Childbirth and breastfeeding: Vaginal dryness is quite common postpartum. In a <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/29855357\/\">2018 study<\/a>, 43% of participants reported lack of vaginal lubrication 6 months postpartum. The study participants who were breastfeeding reported even more symptoms associated with vaginal dryness. <\/li><li>Certain medications: Vaginal dryness can also be a side effect of certain medications such as antidepressants, oral contraceptives, allergy, blood pressure, and heart medications. <\/li><li>Chemotherapy and radiation: Cancer treatment may affect the ovaries, causing them to produce lower levels of the estrogen hormone. As a result, the vaginal lubrication also decreases, leading to vaginal dryness. <\/li><li>Hysterectomies: This refers to the surgical removal of the uterus (womb). A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4720466\/#:~:text=In%20some%20studies%2C%20vaginal%20dryness,dryness%20and%20abnormal%20vaginal%20contractions.\">2015 rewiew study<\/a> on the effects of hysterectomy on women’s sexual function showed that while some researchers reported that vaginal dryness decreases after hysterectomy, others reported the opposite - hysterectomy increases vaginal dryness. <\/li><\/ul><p>All these factors have one thing in common: changing hormonal levels. Even slight changes in hormone levels may affect blood flow to the vaginal walls. In turn, this can lead to dryness down there. <\/p><p>There are also other factors, unrelated to hormonal changes, that may cause vaginal dryness. For instance, people suffering from the autoimmune disease such as Sjogren’s Syndrome may experience vaginal dryness. Also, douching is another common vaginal dryness causing factor that disrupts the natural <a href=\"https:\/\/getfrenchie.com\/blogs\/news\/ph-balance\">vaginal pH balance<\/a> by introducing chemicals  and irritants in your vagina. Certain tampons and condoms may also cause vaginal dryness. <\/p>"

            "custom_text_title": "Top Symptoms of Vaginal Dryness",
            "custom_text_body": "<p>Vaginal dryness is associated with the symptoms listed below. So if you’re experiencing one or more of these symptoms, it’s best to consult with your healthcare provider and take steps to relieve the discomfort (we will get more into that as well). <\/p><h4>1. Vaginal irritation<\/h4><p>Vaginal irritation involves a number of sub-symptoms, such as feeling sore or itchy in and around your vagina. You may also experience a rash in the affected area. This is one of the first and most common symptoms of vaginal dryness. The lack of moisture is sure to wreak havoc on your pH balance and irritate your vagina. <\/p><p>In such cases, hydrating, hypoallergenic, and pH balancing products are very important to help you get back to normal. And of course, you should avoid products that contain harsh chemicals such as glycerin and paraben.<\/p><h4>2. Painful sex<\/h4><p>If you’re experiencing vaginal dryness, no matter the amount of foreplay or how aroused you may feel, things down there will continue to be dry. So penetrative sex will undoubtly be painful.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/getfrenchie.com\/blogs\/news\/best-lubricant-for-menopause-dryness\">Lube<\/a> is your new best friend in this case (and not only)! Just make sure you’re using a lube formula that won’t make your symptoms worse. This means that you should opt for 100% natural and pH balanced lube formulation.<\/p><h4>3. Bleeding following sexual intercourse<\/h4><p>Lots of friction during penetrative sex can sometimes lead to bleeding. If no matter the amount of lube you use this problem persists, then it may be time to consider other forms of pleasure that do not include vaginal penetration. <\/p><h4>4. Lower sex drive<\/h4><p>Another common symptom of vaginal dryness is a lower sex drive. After all, it’s difficult to be in the mood when you are experiencing pain and discomfort. <\/p><p>But if you take the necessary steps to properly moisturize and balance the pH environment down there, the desire will surely follow suit. Plus, you can also help your libido by learning how to foster desire in the bedroom or introducing some <a href=\"\/products\/lamour-dabord-vibe-bundle\" title=\"L'Amour D'Abord Vibe Bundle\">toys<\/a>. <\/p><h4>5. Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)<\/h4><p>Recurrent UTIs are another accompanying symptom of vaginal dryness. A UTI is an infection of the urinary tract, bladder, or urethra that happens when harmful bacteria enter the urinary tract. These infections bring forth another range of symptoms such as abdominal pain and mild fever.<\/p><p>While UTIs are typically treated with antibiotics, you can also speed along the healing process by maintaining proper vaginal hygiene and using products that contain anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal properties.<\/p><h4>6. Burning when you pee<\/h4><p>Low levels of estrogen can lead to inflammation. In turn, the inflammation may cause discomfort when you pee. This is described as a burning or stinging sensation.<\/p><p>Similar as with the above symptoms, using natural, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fungal products can help ease the burning sensation<\/p><h4>7. Having to pee more often than usual<\/h4><p>Frequent peeing can be related to the urinary tract infections or directly to the hormonal imbalance that leads to vaginal dryness. As such, it’s a usual symptom of it. Even though you might not really have to pee, you may still feel the need to go to the bathroom.<\/p><p>Managing the underlying condition - vaginal dryness - will help you find relief from this symptom.<\/p><h4>8. Discomfort throughout the day<\/h4><p>In many cases, vaginal dryness does not cause pain and discomfort only during intercourse or when you pee. Rather, it’s an uncomfortable feeling that accompanies you throughout the day. <\/p><p>So proper hydration of the vagina and all the above tips on how to manage the different symptoms of vaginal dryness will help you get rid of it.<\/p><h4>9. Vaginal discharge changes<\/h4><p>Vaginal discharge is how the body gets rid of harmful bacteria and protects the vagina against infections. As with many other bodily functions, your discharge is highly susceptible to hormonal changes.<\/p><p>There are two types of changes one can expect to experience due to vaginal dryness. One, given the lack of moisture, you can expect to have less discharge, which further perpetuates the dryness. And secondly, hormonal imbalance can lead to changes in the color of your vaginal discharge.<\/p><p>As you focus on regulating your hormonal balance, your discharge related to vaginal dryness will also go back to normal - even though normal varies from person to person.<\/p><h4>10. Emotional distress<\/h4><p>Did you know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC6136974\/\">over 50%<\/a> of women do not report the symptoms of vaginal dryness to their health care provider? This is a surprising statistic. <\/p><p>Since many women still do not feel comfortable reporting vaginal dryness to their doctor, they go through it in silence. This often is due to shame to not only share it with the doctor, but at times, also with their partners. <\/p>"

Besides feeling more natural, these types of lube add an extra layer of hydration to your private parts - which is much needed when you are experiencing vaginal dryness. Add in that the moisturizing and soothing effects of Aloe Vera, and this becomes your best combination in a lube that can help you ease the symptoms of vaginal dryness.<\/p><h4>Personal Wipes<\/h4><p>Personal wipes are easy to use whenever you need to freshen up during the day. Find the right wipes’ formula and you will have in your hands the perfect on-the-go <a href=\"\/products\/oui-oui-wipes\" title=\"Oui Oui Wipes\">pH balancing wipes<\/a>. Also you should look for wipes that are alcohol and fragrance-free, hypoallergenic, safe, and infused with anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal properties. This perfect combination will aid your vaginal dryness healing process and provide you with relief from its uncomfortable symptoms.<\/p><h4>Vegan Condoms<\/h4><p>By definition, vegan means to only use natural, plant-based, and non-synthetic ingredients. This makes <a href=\"\/products\/condom-0-05-12\" title=\"The Beret Condom 0.05mm x 12\">vegan condoms<\/a> a great choice for sensitive skin, which is the case of intimate skin with vaginal dryness symptoms. <\/p><h4>Condoms with Hyaluronic Acid<\/h4><p>You might be thinking that something with Acid in its name shouldn’t be anywhere near your vagina. That’s not the case when it comes to Hyaluronic Acid. <a href=\"\/products\/condom-0-05-ha-12\" title=\"The Beret Condom 0.05mm With Hyaluronic Acid x 12\">Hyaluronic Acid<\/a> is a known moisturiser due to its ability to bind water to the skin, preventing it from evaporating quickly.
