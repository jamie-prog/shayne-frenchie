But, it can be overwhelming to just find a random list of herbs and go hunting in your local health food shop in the hopes that something might help. I always recommend against simply taking something because it worked for someone else on the internet. It’s important to always get personalised advice from a professional. Find a qualified naturopath who specialises in menstrual health and who can make custom herbal tinctures to target exactly what your body needs. Personally, I have worked with <a href=\"http:\/\/tiamiers.com.au\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Tia Miers Naturopathy<\/span><\/a> who has helped take my endo pain from a 12 out of 10 to a 3 out of 10 in under six months. I felt improvements within the first month and my pain has reduced significantly with each period since. You can also try hormone balancing supplements for extra support if you are unable to see a naturopath right away.<\/p>"

Having a laparoscopy can be helpful for those experiencing intense, debilitating pain. There are two types of laparoscopic surgery with it comes to endo: excision, which is when they remove the problematic endometrial tissue by cutting it out, or ablation where they destroy the cells via diathermy. Some people find that their endo doesn’t come back for up to 5 years after surgery, and some find it does after only a year, so if you are considering surgery it’s best to speak in depth with your doctor and gynaecologist. I would always recommend using other supportive treatments in tandem to ensure it doesn’t come back, too.<\/p><p>This is definitely not an exhaustive list of things that can help with endometriosis, but it’s a great place to start. Above all else, always be sure to listen to your body and trust that you will find relief.<\/p>"
