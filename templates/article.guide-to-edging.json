It’s important to listen to your body and respect your own boundaries.<\/p><p>So there you have it, all the answers as to why you should try edging, and if you ask us, we can’t think of a reason not to! Experimenting away from the tried and tested techniques may seem like a chore, but don’t be afraid to edge closer (haha!) to pleasure and unlock an orgasm that will have you fantasising for days! <\/p>"
