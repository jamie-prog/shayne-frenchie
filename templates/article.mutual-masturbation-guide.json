Make sure your bed, sofa, bathtub, floor is a comfortable and safe place where you both can relax. Before you start going to town, take a moment to breathe and look into each other’s eyes to be present in the moment and with each other. Keep the communication open, tell your partner what you’d like to see, and how attracted you are to them. <\/p>"
