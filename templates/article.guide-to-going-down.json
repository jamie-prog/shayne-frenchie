To speak in the binary, when you’ve only had sex with men before you start dating women, it can feel daunting to know who takes the lead when traditional gender roles no longer exist. But I encourage you to see this as an invitation for you to open up your world to new possibilities and ways of relating. When it comes to WLW relationships, there are no unspoken rules about who makes the first move, or who comes first. To begin with, it can take some time to shed yourself of the cis het conditioning, but as you begin your exploration you’ll feel a sense of freedom you may have been missing before. <\/p>"

Buckle up, because your sex life is about to multiply. Given the very different way that men and women experience orgasm, sex between women tends to last a lot longer. Some research suggests that the duration of sex between women tends to be 2-4 times longer than straight sex. A huge reason for this is our ability to have multiple orgasms, and the focus being about the experience of pleasure as opposed to racing towards one ejaculatory orgasm and then calling it a day. With this being said, I encourage you to rethink the way you view sex and reframe pleasure as the purpose, as opposed to orgasm being the goal.<\/p>"

With a pointed tongue, you can now begin to weave your way up the inner labia and around the clit, perhaps drawing zig zag patterns across the labia or circling the clit. Tease the entrance to the vagina by clicking the tongue around the area and even sliding a tongue gently inside.<\/p><p>When you get to the clit, there’s lots of options for ways to stimulate this sensitive area. As always, check in with your partner and read their body for what they are responding to. You can flick your tongue up and down or side to side, gently suck or pulsate your tongue along the tip.<\/p><p>For more in depth demos, check out my Pussy Pro series. <\/p>"

So, as always, it’s really important to ask your lover whether or not they would like them, before you introduce fingers into the mix. If it’s an enthusiastic <em>yes<\/em>, then you’re good to go.<\/p><p>There’s much debate about which fingers are the ‘right’ fingers to use when it comes to fingering. But really, the only right answer is what you and your partner feel most comfortable with. I suggest using Frenchie’s Oh La La Love Lube to decrease friction and increase pleasure. <\/p><p>You might like to begin with just one finger, slowly entering and pulsating to get a feel for what your partner responds to. From there generally you can use either your pointer and middle finger, or middle and ring. <\/p><p>Each combo has its pros and cons. Pointer + Middle gives you a bit more strength and endurance. Whereas Middle and ring allow the other fingers (pointer and pinky) to act as a sort of ‘frame’, essentially massaging the labia as you work your magic inside. Whichever you choose, there’s many ways you can make your lover writhe in delight through the power of your digits. <\/p><p>The most tried and true method is the <em>come hither<\/em> fingers which work wonders on the g-zone. Once your two fingers of choice are inside, slightly curl your fingers into a hook as though you are telling someone to ‘come here’ (well, I guess you kind of are, aren’t you?). From here, you can explore with speed and pressure, pulsating on the squishy round area known as the ‘g-spot’. You can also massage the area and see what your lover likes. To save you from finger fatigue, a popular method is to have your elbow at a right angle and move from your shoulder to guide your fingers up and back against the g-spot. <\/p><p>We have a hell of a lot of erogenous zones inside our vaginal canal, so you might like to explore more, asking your lover where it feels good and stopping to stimulate that zone. Remember that fingers aren’t a proxy cock, so you don’t have to use them the same way you would a penis, unless that's what your partner likes, of course. Get creative and follow the pleasure!<\/p>"
