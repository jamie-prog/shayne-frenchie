If you haven’t tried it, masturbating in front of each other is not only very sexy, but it’s also an amazing opportunity to show your partner what turns you on when it comes to erotic touch. You can learn from each other and practice completely new types of touch. I also like to encourage clients to do this in front of a mirror. It can be amazingly empowering watching ourselves (and our partners) getting off. <\/p><p>If you get a bit of performance anxiety - that’s ok! It’s very normal. Remember pleasure is the goal of the game - not orgasm.  <\/p><p>If you’re single, try masturbating in front of a mirror. Learn more about your genitals by watching them change when they become aroused, and feel empowered by how incredible you look when you are experiencing pleasure!<\/p><p>What to do:<\/p><p><strong>﻿Set the scene: <\/strong><\/p><p>Set up your environment so it feels as pleasurable as possible (you’ll be getting good at this!). Decide what would make you both as comfortable and sexy as possible - eg lighting and lingerie. <\/p><p>Get any lube, vibrators, and any toys or items you would like to have with you, plus a hand mirror or full length mirror. <\/p><p><strong>﻿Agree the rules of the game:  <\/strong><\/p><p>Discuss any fears or worries you both might have ahead of masturbating in front of each other. Discuss what you’re curious about. Agree if you will each only touch yourself, or whether touching each other is also allowed if invited to do so. ;)<strong><br\/><\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Give the touch!<\/strong> Try and vary up the touch, starting somewhere that’s not your genitals.

With practice, it can be used as an 'erotic pump', deliberately and mindfully increasing or decreasing how aroused we feel. It also makes us feel grounded, connected, and awakens our nervous system to be able to feel more pleasure. This game is a simple introduction to breathwork, drawing from tantric practices.<\/p><p><strong>What to do:<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>﻿Set the scene: <\/strong><\/p><p>Set up your environment so it feels as pleasurable as possible.

Practice doing some deep breaths together first, breathing all the way down into your belly.

Maintain eye contact, looking into their left eye. Keep your eyes open, gazing with stillness and calm.  While gazing start to watch your breath. Watch how you breathe in and breath out. <\/p><p>Slowly, think about synchronzing your breath with the breathing of your partner.  Don’t force anything, just let happen what wants to happen.  Be as present as you can be. If your mind wanders off, just return to the synchronized breathing and the eye-gazing. Slowly start to incorporate erotic movement and touch to yourselves and each other. Move to the music together.

We are literally getting ourselves right to the edge of the peak of pleasure, and then purposefully walking ourselves back from the edge. This is an amazing technique to make orgasms feel stronger and more pleasurable, and also to increase your awareness and control of your own ‘arousal spectrum’. If we learn how to mindfully come down from the edge of orgasm, this can help with concerns such as premature ejaculation and difficulty orgasming.  <\/p><p> <\/p><p><strong>What to do:<\/strong><\/p><p>﻿Set the scene:  Make the environment as sexy and sensual as possible.

If this is your first time practicing edging, start with just one or two ‘edges’ each.  Agree on a word that you will say when you have reached your ‘edge’ and would like stimulation to stop so you can come back down. ‘Edge’ works pretty well!<\/p><p><strong>Give the touch! <\/strong><\/p><p>Do whatever feels good. Connect, play, touch. You might want to start with some of the things you have learnt already, such as some erotic massage, sensation play, breathwork, or self-touch in front of each other. Build arousal in your bodies and take your time. When you feel relaxed and aroused, take turns playing with getting to the ‘edge’ and coming back down.
