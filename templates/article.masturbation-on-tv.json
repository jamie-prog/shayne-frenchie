Why? Well we can think of a number of reasons, including potential burning of your intimate area, higher risk of infection (imagine you don’t get all the apple pie particles out) and of course the mess.<\/p><p>If you are looking for a more “real” feeling solo session, there are plenty of toys out there that you can use. As always, opt for some that are made from high grade silicone, making it easier for you to clean and reduce the mess.<\/p>"

Before, the only women on the screen that would masturbate were the ones hypersexualised, often portrayed as sex-crazy women. However, this coming-of-age show depicts masturbation as something everyone does, which is refreshing. <\/p><p>The taboos and reservations surrounding female self pleasure is seen a few times throughout the show, but this is most obvious when Aimee’s boyfriend asks her to tell him what she likes without doing what she thinks she needs to do to get him off. Aimee then seeks the help of Otis (the school’s unqualified sexpert) who suggests that she try masturbating to figure out what she likes. She’s shocked that Otis suggested that, saying that she’s never done that alone and always relies on boyfriend. This myth that women need a partner to get off is a common belief, I mean when most sex scenes and porn is made for the male viewer, it’s no wonder why! <\/p><p>However, as women we have all heard some variation of the words “you’ll find love when you love yourself” (which is a whole different tangent we can go on), but this is actually true for self pleasure, you will only find what works for you when you figure it out on your own!<\/p>"
