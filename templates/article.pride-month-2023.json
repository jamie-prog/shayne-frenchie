A few of my friends and thousands of people were all standing in Prince Alfred Park in Sydney. When it was announced live that we had won the vote for Australia to legalise same sex marriage. The amount of love, tears and joy that we felt that day was indescribable. As we watched same sex partners that had been together for years cry tears of joy and kiss one another, so hopeful for the future and future generations to come. That was my ultimate feeling of pride!<\/p><p><strong>In your opinion, what is the most powerful thing that allies can do to support and uplift the LGBTQIA+ community?<\/strong><\/p><p>Being an ally to me is championing the LGBTIQ+ communities, being aware of inequality and calling it out where it exists and creating safe and inclusive spaces. Above all it means listening to the community's experiences and affirming and elevating their voices.<\/p><p><strong>If you could go back in time, what would you tell your younger self?<\/strong><\/p><p>My advice to my younger self is to not sweat the small stuff, to know that your sexuality doesn’t define who you are, it's actually quite a small part of you, and you are wonderful in every single way, with whoever you choose to love. But also remember, coming out isn’t like flicking a switch or moving to a new city. Coming out can be an evoking process of being honest with yourself, there is no rush and there also isn’t anything wrong with not wanting to label yourself either. Love is love and that’s all that matters! Be proud of who you are and do things at your own pace when you feel ready and comfortable to do so.<\/p><p>I’m very proud to be gay and thankful for my support network and accepting family. Some don’t have it as easy so always be gentle with others and yourself.<\/p>"
