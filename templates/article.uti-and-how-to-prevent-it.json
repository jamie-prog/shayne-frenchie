A lot of the bacteria that can cause UTI’s live around the anus, and the physical act i.e. thrusting, of sexual intercourse, can shift bacteria from the back passage toward the urethra, where they can travel up and make themselves home. Females have a shorter urethra (tube passing from the outside of the body to the bladder), which makes it much easier for bacteria to travel up into the bladder and cause an infection.<\/p>"

Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea, Mycoplasma and Herpes can all infect the urinary tract and hence, cause pain when passing urine.<\/p><p>When gonorrhea symptoms occur, they usually appear 1-14 days after infection [1]. The difference is, that in addition to painful urination, symptoms for women include vaginal bleeding between periods, pain during sex, bleeding after sex, abdominal or pelvic pain and\/or unusual vaginal discharge. Additional symptoms for men may include painful, swollen testicles, and\/or yellow, white, or green discharge from the penis.<\/p><p>With chlamydia, if symptoms appear at all, they typically occur 1-3 weeks after infection [2]. When they do, symptoms for women in addition to painful urination can include similar symptoms to that of Gonorrhoeae, including painful sex, bleeding after sex, vaginal bleeding between periods and\/or abnormal genital discharge. Men may experience those same symptoms as well as potential pain or swelling in the testicles. Chlamydia can also infect the rectum in men and women, in which case rectal pain, discharge and bleeding may occur (ouch!).<\/p><p>At least 85-90% of people infected with Chlamydia and Gonorrhoea do not experience any symptoms however [3][4]. This is <em>different<\/em> for UTI’s where most people will experience symptoms, unless older, where symptoms can be less localised and present with things like confusion, and decline in function.<\/p>"

This entrance skin is thinner and more sensitive than in men, with irritation predisposing to damage and a potential home for bacteria to make their way up the urethra<\/p><p>3- the female urethra is located closer to the anus, which carries waste and bacteria such as E. coli out of the body, with E.Coli the number 1 culprit bacteria for UTI’s overall.<\/p><p>4- hormonal changes, specifically pre menstrually and in the menopause, can change the microbiome and immune defenses, as well as integrity of the vaginal mucosa of the area (think drier, and thinner), allowing culprit bacteria to replicate and cause infection more easily<\/p><p>UTI’s in men however (specifically cystitis or infection of the bladder) occurs in a very <em>small<\/em> proportion of males between 15 and 50 years of age, with an incidence is approximately five to eight urinary tract infections (UTIs) per year per 10,000 young to middle-aged males [6,7].

Try our super cute and hydrating beret <a href=\"\/products\/deux-beret-condom-bundle\" title=\"Deux Beret Condom Bundle\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">condoms<\/span><\/a> that don’t just look cute, but perform their job, eliminate confusion in the heat of things, and minimise irritation.<\/p><p>2- <strong>Wipe front to back<\/strong>: this is an obvious one for ladies, but important to reduce the chance of bacteria from the back passage moving forward towards the urethra. It’s always handy to have some of our <a href=\"\/products\/oui-oui-wipes\" title=\"Oui Oui Wipes\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">personal wipes<\/span><\/a> in your purse\/bag to stay fresh on the go, wherever you are.<\/p><p>3- <strong>Get regular STI screening with your GP<\/strong>: Current RACGP (Royal Australian College of General Practitioners) <a href=\"https:\/\/www.racgp.org.au\/download\/Documents\/Guidelines\/Redbook9\/17048-Red-Book-9th-Edition.pdf\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">guideline<\/span><\/a> [8] recommend that all people aged 15-29 get STI screening for chlamydia and gonorrhoea at least once a year, with approximately 1 in 20 of those currently testing returning positive tests for chlamydia, often with no symptoms! The frequency of testing, and types of test required (HIV, Hep B, Syphillis etc) also change based on populations and sexual activity e.g. men who have sex with men are recommended to get tested every 3 months.<\/p><p>4- <strong>Avoid potentially irritating feminine products: <\/strong>avoid douches, feminine deodorants and powders, they smell nice, but these can irritate the area and disrupt the pH which will predispose to UTI. Rather, wash between the legs with warm water only and no soap. This will ensure the pH of the area is not disrupted.<\/p><p>5-<strong> Consider alternative birth control: <\/strong>ditch the diaphragma, unlubricated condoms and spermicide, and talk to your doctor about alternative contraceptives, like our <a href=\"\/products\/condom-0-05-ha-12\" title=\"The Beret Condom 0.05mm With Hyaluronic Acid x 12\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">hyaluronic acid condoms<\/span>.<\/a><\/p><p>6- <strong>Always, always pee after sex: <\/strong>try to make sure you go to the toilet and urinate shortly after, as this flushes out any bacteria that may have travelled to your urethra from your love making. Follow this with a healthy guzzle of water. Studies frequently show that women, who urinated within 15 min of intercourse, had a lower likelihood of developing a UTI than women who did not urinate afterward [9].<\/p><p>7- <strong>Do not share sex toys<\/strong>: this is a no brainer, as this can act as a home for bacteria. Ensure you clean your toys, like our flexible and fun <a href=\"\/products\/the-double-entendre\" title=\"The Double Entendre\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Double Entendre<\/span> <\/a>regularly. And don’t forget, if using sex toys in the bedroom, pop one of our cute beret condoms on top, you will hardly notice the difference but have all the protection!<\/p><p>8- <strong>Wear loose clothing and cotton underwear<\/strong>: this will reduce changes to the flora in the area that can predispose to UTIs.<\/p><p>9<strong>- Use pH friendly lubricants<\/strong>: many lubricants on the market are not pH friendly to the acidic environment of the vagina and contain irritant ingredients, both factors can predispose to UTI’s, so look for one like our <a href=\"\/products\/love-lube\" title=\"Oh La La Love Lube\">Oh La La <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Love Lube<\/span><\/a> that has been specifically formulated to be kind and gentle to your skin.<\/p>"
