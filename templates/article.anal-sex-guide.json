Like everything in life, especially sex, if the idea of anal sex doesn’t doesn’t bring out an enthusiastic yes, then you probably shouldn’t do it.<\/li><li><strong>Don't feel pressured<\/strong> - Remember, you're in control. Don't feel pressured to do anything you're not comfortable with, and don't be afraid to speak up.<\/li><li>Talk it out - <strong>Communication is key<\/strong>! Make sure you and your partner have an open and honest conversation about what you both want and expect from the experience. Don't be shy, speak up!<\/li><li><strong>Always use a condom<\/strong>.

Although getting yourself ready for anal sex can be as simple as some soap and water, some people prefer that extra squeaky clean feeling. Anal douching can help clean the anus before the experience. Cleanse that booty!<\/li><li><strong>Keep it clean<\/strong>. While you probably won’t have to worry about pooping on your partner, all parties need to be aware that there might be exposure to visible or invisible fecal matter. Make sure you're clean before and after the experience to avoid any infections. Cleanliness is next to godliness.<\/li><li><strong>Work up to penetration slowly<\/strong>. Before trying penetration, use small toys or fingers to gradually stretch the anus. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither should your anal experience.<\/li><li><strong>Keep your nails short<\/strong> - Long nails can cause discomfort or even scratching during anal play. Make sure your nails are trimmed and clean before getting down to business.<\/li><li><strong>Don't switch it up<\/strong> - Avoid switching from anal to vaginal sex without cleaning up first to avoid any infections. Trust us; this is not the time to mix things up.<\/li><\/ol>"

Don't be shy to bring them into the mix!<\/li><li><strong>Consider the size of the toy<\/strong>. Sometimes bigger isn’t always better, especially when you are using the toy as a stepping stone for something bigger like a strap on or a penis. Start small and slow, and work your way up to bigger toys!<\/li><li>Vibrate your way to happiness.<strong> A vibrator can stimulate the anus<\/strong> and make the experience more pleasurable. A <a href=\"\/products\/the-petit-eiffel\" title=\"The Petit Eiffel\">mini vibrator<\/a> can be used to explore the perineum and the outside of the anus to start you off and get you used to pleasure in the region. However, do not use a mini vibrator internally unless it has a flared base, as it could get stuck and your fun and sexy rendezvous could land you in the emergency room. If you are looking for a vibrator for internal stimulation, go for a <a href=\"\/products\/the-double-entendre\" title=\"The Double Entendre\">dual bendable vibrator<\/a>. The bend in the vibrator will allow you to insert it into the anus without having the fear that it may get lost.<\/li><li><strong>Experiment with butt plugs<\/strong>. A butt plug can help prepare you for penetration and make the experience more comfortable. They come in all shapes and sizes, and you can use it to get primed for bigger things, or wear it during the day to get you in the mood. Who knew a plug could be so helpful?<\/li><li>Strap-on fun - <strong>A strap-on can be a fun way to experiment<\/strong> with anal sex. Let your inner dominatrix come out to play.<\/li><\/ol>"
